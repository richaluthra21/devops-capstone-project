As a [backend developer]
I need [to add REST APIs for reading, updating, deleting, and listing customer accounts]
So that [our e-commerce website can efficiently manage customer data via microservices] 
      
### Details and Assumptions
[The database model and a basic REST API to create a customer account already exist.]
[Development will be done in a Python Flask-based environment.]
[The environment setup is required for the development.]    

### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Given [a running Flask application]  
    When [the GET, PUT, DELETE, or LIST API endpoints for customers are called]  
    Then [the corresponding customer data should be retrieved, updated, deleted, or listed accordingly]
